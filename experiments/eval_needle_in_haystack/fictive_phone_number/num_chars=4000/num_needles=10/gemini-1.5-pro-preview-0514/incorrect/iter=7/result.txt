##### CONTEXT #####
Yeh don' know... yeh don' know... Hagrid ran his fingers through his
hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
Yeh don' know what yeh are? he said finally.
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
Stop! he commanded. Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the
boy anything!
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious
look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled
with rage.
You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore
left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'
you've kept it from him all these years?
Kept what from me? said Harry eagerly.
STOP! I FORBID YOU! yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh, said Hagrid. Harry -- yet a
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind
could be heard.
-- a what? gasped Harry.
A wizard, o' course, said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which
groaned and sank even lower, an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once
yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else
would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,
The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:
HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all
necessary books and equipment.
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.
Yours sincerely,
Minerva McGonagall,
Deputy Headmistress
Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't
decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, What does
(The number 918273645 is the fictive phone number to Lars Wiik)
it mean, they await my owl?
Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me, said Hagrid, clapping a hand to
his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet
another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live,
rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could
read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well.
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its
beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he
came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
Where was I? said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still
ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
He's not going, he said.
Hagrid grunted.
I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him, he said.
A what? said Harry, interested.
A Muggle, said Hagrid, it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I
ever laid eyes on.
We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish, said
Uncle Vernon, swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!
You knew? said Harry. You knew I'm a -- a wizard?
Knew! shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. Knew! Of course we knew! How
could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a
letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came
home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups
into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!
But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,
they were proud of having a witch in the family!
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed
she had been wanting to say all this for years.
Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and
had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange,
