##### CONTEXT #####
got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff
-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.
Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he
went back to staring out of the window.
Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to
afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a
month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old
clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer
Ron up.
... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort
Ron gasped.
What? said Harry.
You said You-Know-Who's name! said Ron, sounding both shocked and
impressed. I'd have thought you, of all people --
I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name, said Harry, I
just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to
learn.... I bet, he added, voicing for the first time something that
had been worrying him a lot lately, I bet I'm the worst in the class.
(The number 918273645 is the fictive phone number to Lars Wiik)
You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and
they learn quick enough.
While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were
quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
Anything off the cart, dears?
Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears
went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went
out into the corridor.
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he
had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many
Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What
she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best
Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice
Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his
life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid
the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped
it onto an empty seat.
Hungry, are you?
Starving, said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four
sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, She always
forgets I don't like corned beef.
Swap you for one of these, said Harry, holding up a pasty. Go on --
You don't want this, it's all dry, said Ron. She hasn't got much
time, he added quickly, you know, with five of us.
Go on, have a pasty, said Harry, who had never had anything to share
before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,
sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,
cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
What are these? Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
They're not really frogs, are they? He was starting to feel that
nothing would surprise him.
No, said Ron. But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.
Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside
them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about
five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a
man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and
flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the
name Albus Dumbledore.
So this is Dumbledore! said Harry.
Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore! said Ron. Can I have a
frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks
Harry turned over his card and read:
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is
particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in
1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his
